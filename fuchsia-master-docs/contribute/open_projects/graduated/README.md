# Graduated projects

After a project graduates, move it to this section to:

*   Indicate that the work is complete and no more help is needed.
*   Celebrate your mighty achievement.
*   Create an online trophy room of team accomplishments, which will help
    promote a culture of responsible tech debt stewardship on the team. Yay us!
