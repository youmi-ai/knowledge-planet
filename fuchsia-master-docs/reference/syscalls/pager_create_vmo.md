## NAME

<!-- Updated by update-docs-from-fidl, do not edit. -->

Create a pager owned vmo.

## SYNOPSIS

<!-- Updated by update-docs-from-fidl, do not edit. -->

```c
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_pager_create_vmo(zx_handle_t pager,
                                uint32_t options,
                                zx_handle_t port,
                                uint64_t key,
                                uint64_t size,
                                zx_handle_t* out);
```

## DESCRIPTION

Creates a VMO owned by a pager object. *size* will be rounded up to the next page size
boundary, and *options* must be zero or **ZX_VMO_RESIZABLE**.

On success, the returned vmo has the same rights as a vmo created with [`zx_vmo_create()`], as well
as having the same behavior with respect to **ZX_VMO_ZERO_CHILDREN**. Syscalls that operate on VMOs
require an explicit flag to allow blocking IPC to the userspace pager service; beyond this, whether
or not a VMO is owned by a pager does not affect the semantics of syscalls.

TODO(stevend): Update differences after updates to cloning and decommit

Page requests will be delivered to *port* when certain conditions are met. Those packets will have
*type* set to **ZX_PKT_TYPE_PAGE_REQUEST** and *key* set to the value provided to
`zx_pager_create_vmo()`. The packet's union is of type `zx_packet_page_request_t`:

```
typedef struct zx_packet_page_request {
    uint16_t command;
    uint16_t flags;
    uint32_t reserved0;
    uint64_t offset;
    uint64_t length;
    uint64_t reserved1;
} zx_packet_page_request_t;
```

*offset* and *length* are always page-aligned. The value of any bits in *flags* for which flags
are not defined is unspecified - currently no flags are defined. The trigger and meaning of
the packet depends on *command*, which can take one of the following values:

**ZX_PAGER_VMO_READ**: Sent when an application accesses a non-resident page in a pager's VMO. The
pager service should populate the range [offset, offset + length) in the registered vmo with
[`zx_pager_supply_pages()`]. Supplying pages is an implicit positive acknowledgement of the request.

**ZX_PAGER_VMO_COMPLETE**: Sent when no more pager requests will be sent for the corresponding
VMO, either because of [`zx_pager_detach_vmo()`] or because no references to the VMO remain.

If *pager* is closed, then no more packets will be delivered to *port* (including no
**ZX_PAGER_VMO_COMPLETE** message). Furthermore, all future accesses will behave as if
[`zx_pager_detach_vmo()`] had been called.

## RIGHTS

<!-- Updated by update-docs-from-fidl, do not edit. -->

*pager* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_PAGER**.

*port* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_PORT** and have **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE**.

## RETURN VALUE

`zx_pager_create_vmo()` returns ZX_OK on success, or one of the following error codes on failure.

## ERRORS

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS** *out* is an invalid pointer or NULL, or *options* is any value other than
0 or **ZX_VMO_RESIZABLE**.

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE** *pager* or *port* is not a valid handle.

**ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** *port* does not have **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE**.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE** *pager* is not a pager handle or *port* is not a port handle.

**ZX_ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE** The requested size is larger than the maximum vmo size.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
