# zxdb: The Fuchsia debugger

Zxdb is a console-mode debugger for native code running on Fuchsia.

It primarily supports C, C++ and Rust code, but any language that compiles natively and exports
DWARF symbols should work to some extent (such as Go). Interpreted code such as Dart and JavaScript
are not supported.
