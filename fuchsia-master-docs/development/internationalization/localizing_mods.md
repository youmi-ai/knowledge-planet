# Localizing mods

Note: this page is under construction.

The process of localizing mods includes internationalizing the content,
translating the content, and assembling the localization bundle for the mod to
use.

For an example localization, see
[localized flutter app example in dart][locapp].

For a more complete example, look at the [Ermine shell localization][ermineloc].
