# Component manifests (Components v2) {#component-manifests}

<<../_v2_banner.md>>

A [component manifest](#component-manifest) is a file that defines a component
by encoding a [component declaration](#component-declaration). This document
gives an overview of the concepts used by component declarations, and presents
the syntax for writing [component manifest source](#component-manifest-source).
Component declarations contain:

-   Information about [how to run the component](#runtime).
-   The component's [child component instances][doc-children] and
    [component collections][doc-collections].
-   [Routing rules](#capability-routing) that describe how capabilities are
    used, exposed, and offered between components.
-   [Freeform data ("facets")](#facet-metadata), which is ignored by the
    component framework but can be interpreted by third parties.

## Manifests and declarations {#manifests-and-declarations}

This section explains the distinction between component manifests, component
manifest sources, and component declarations.

### Component manifest {#component-manifest}

A *component manifest* is a file that encodes a
[component declaration](#component-declaration), usually distributed as part of
a [package][doc-packages]. The binary format is a persisted FIDL file mapping
one-to-one onto the component declaration, typically ending in a `.cm`
extension.

A [fuchsia-pkg URL][doc-package-url] with a component manifest resource path
identifies a component in a package.

### Component manifest source {#component-manifest-source}

A *component manifest source* is a file that encodes part of a component
manifest. Component manifest sources are written in *CML* (*component manifest
language*), which is the developer-facing source format for component manifests.
CML files are JSON5 files that end with a `.cml` extension. Descriptions and
examples of the CML syntax are contained in this document: see
[Syntax](#syntax).

Component manifest sources are compiled to
[component manifests](#component-manifest) by the [`cmc`][src-cmc] tool.

### Component declaration {#component-declaration}

The [`ComponentDecl`][fidl-component-decl] FIDL table is a *component
declaration*. Component declarations are used by the component framework APIs to
represent components and may be provided to components at runtime.

## Concepts {#concepts}

### Runtime {#runtime}

The component framework doesn't dictate a particular format for programs, but
instead requires components to specify which runtime they need by specifying a
[runner][doc-runners]. The component framework provides a built-in ELF runner,
while other runtimes are implemented as components within the framework. A
component can use any runner available in its [environment][doc-environments].

The [`program`](#program) section of a component manifest designates a runner
and declares to the runner how the component is run, such as the program
location and any arguments. Components using the ELF runner should specify the
binary name and arguments, see [ELF Runner](elf_runner.md).
[Other runners][doc-runners] may have other runner-specific details, documented
by that runner.

A component may also have no runtime at all by omitting the `program` section.
In this case, the component may still route capabilities and host children, but
no code will be executed for the component.

### Capability routing {#capability-routing}

Component manifests provide a syntax for routing capabilities between
components. For a detailed walkthrough about what happens during capability
routing, see [_Life of a protocol open_](life_of_a_protocol_open.md)

#### Capability types {#capability-types}

The following capabilities can be routed:

-   `protocol`: A filesystem service node that can be used to open a channel to
    a FIDL protocol.
-   `directory`: A filesystem directory.
-   `storage`: A filesystem directory that is isolated to the component using
    it.
-   `runner`: A capability that allows a component to use a particular
    [runner][doc-runners].
-   `resolver`: A capability that, when registered in an
    [environment](#environments), causes a component with a particular URL scheme
    to be resolved with that [resolver][doc-resolvers].

`protocol`, `directory` and `storage` capabilities are routed to components that
`use` them. `runner` capabilities are routed to [environments](#environments)
that include them.

#### Routing terminology {#routing-terminology}

Component manifests declare how capabilities are routed between components. The
language of capability routing consists of the following three keywords:

-   `use`: When a component `uses` a capability, the capability is installed in
    the component's namespace. A component may `use` any capability that has
    been `offered` to it.
-   `offer`: A component may `offer` a capability to a *target*, which is either
    a [child][doc-children] or [collection][doc-collections]. When a capability
    is offered to a child, the child instance may `use` the capability or
    `offer` it to one of its own targets. Likewise, when a capability is offered
    to a collection, any instance in the collection may `use` the capability or
    `offer` it.
-   `expose`: When a component `exposes` a capability to its parent, the parent
    may `offer` the capability to one of its other children. A component may
    `expose` any capability that it provides, or that one of its children
    exposes.

When you use these keywords together, they express how a capability is routed
from a component instance's [outgoing directory][doc-outgoing-directory] to
another component instance's namespace:

-   `use` describes the capabilities that populate a component instance's
    namespace.
-   `expose` and `offer` describe how capabilities are passed between component
    instances. Aside from their directionality, there is one significant
    difference between `offer` and `expose`. While a component may `use` a
    capability that was `offered` to it, a component is not allowed to `use` a
    capability that was `exposed` to it by its child. This restriction exists to
    prevent dependency cycles between parent and child.

#### Framework protocols {#framework-protocols}

A *framework protocol* is a protocol provided by the component framework.
Because the component framework itself provides the protocol, any component may
`use` it without an explicit `offer`. Fuchsia supports the following framework
protocols:

-   [`fuchsia.sys2.Realm`][fidl-realm]: Allows a component to manage and bind to
    its children. Scoped to the component's realm.

#### Framework directories {#framework-directories}

A *framework directory* is a directory provided by the component framework.
Because the component framework itself is the provider of the directory, any
component may `use` it without an explicit `offer`. Fuchsia supports the
following framework directories:

-   [`hub`][glossary-hub]: Allows a component to perform runtime introspection
    of itself and its children.

#### Capability names {#capability-names}

Capabilities are identified by a capability name. A capability name consists of
a string containing the characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`,
underscore (`_`), hyphen (`-`), or the full stop character (`.`).

#### Directory rights {#directory-rights}

Directory rights define how a directory may be accessed in the component
framework. You must specify directory rights on `use` declarations and on
`expose` and `offer` declarations from `self`. On `expose` and `offer`
declarations not from `self`, they are optional.

A *rights* field can be defined by the combination of any of the following
rights tokens:

```json5
rights: ["connect", "enumerate", "read_bytes", "write_bytes", "execute_bytes",
         "update_attributes", "get_attributes", "traverse", "modify_directory"]
```

See [`fuchsia.io2.Rights`][fidl-io2-rights] for the equivalent FIDL definitions.

However *rights aliases* should be preferred where possible for clarity.

```json5
rights: ["r*", "w*", "x*", "rw*", "rx*"]
```

Except in special circumstances you will almost always want either `["r*"]` or
`["rw*"]`. Only one alias can be provided to a rights field and it must not
conflict with any longform rights.

Right aliases are simply expanded into their longform counterparts:

```
"r*" -> ["connect", "enumerate", "traverse", "read_bytes", "get_attributes"]
"w*" -> ["connect", "enumerate", "traverse", "write_bytes", "update_attributes", "modify_directory"]
"x*" -> ["connect", "enumerate", "traverse", "execute_bytes"]
```

Merged aliases like `rw*` are simply `r*` and `w*` merged without duplicates.

This example shows usage of a directory use declaration annotated with rights:

```json5
use: [
    {
        directory: "test",
        from: "parent",
        rights: ["rw*", "admin"],
        path: "/data/test",
    },
],
```

#### Examples {#examples}

For an example of how these keywords interact, consider the following component
instance tree:

<br>![Capability routing example](images/capability_routing_example.png)<br>

In this example, the `echo` component instance provides an `fuchsia.Echo`
protocol in its outgoing directory. This protocol is routed to the `echo_tool`
component instance, which uses it. It is necessary for each component instance
in the routing path to propagate `fuchsia.Echo` to the next component instance.

The routing sequence is:

-   `echo` hosts the `fuchsia.Echo` protocol in its outgoing directory. Also, it
    exposes `fuchsia.Echo` from `self` so the protocol is visible to its parent,
    `services`.
-   `services` exposes `fuchsia.Echo` from its child `echo` to its parent,
    `shell`.
-   `system` offers `fuchsia.Echo` from its child `services` to its other child
    `tools`.
-   `tools` offers `fuchsia.Echo` from `parent` (i.e., its parent) to its child
    `echo_tool`.
-   `echo_tool` uses `fuchsia.Echo`. When `echo_tool` runs, it will find
    `fuchsia.Echo` in its namespace.

A working example of capability routing can be found at
[//examples/components/routing][examples-routing].

### Facet metadata {#facet-metadata}

*Facets* are metadata that is ignored by the component framework itself, but may
be interpreted by interested components.

## Syntax {#syntax}

This section describes the syntax for each section of the component manifest, in
CML format.

### References {#references}

A *reference* is a string of the form `#<reference-name>`, where
`<reference-name>` is a string of one or more of the following characters:
`a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`, `-`.

A reference may refer to:

-   A [static child instance][doc-static-children] whose name is
    `<reference-name>`.
-   A [collection][doc-collections] whose name is `<reference-name>`.

### include {#include}

The optional `include` property describes zero or more other component manifest
files (or shards) to be merged into this component manifest. For example:

```json5
include: [ "src/lib/syslog/client.shard.cml" ]
```

In the example given above, the component manifest is including contents from a
manifest shard provided by the `syslog` library, thus ensuring that the
component functions correctly at runtime if it attempts to write to syslog. By
convention such files end with `.shard.cml`.

If working in fuchsia.git, include paths are relative to the source root of the
Fuchsia tree.

You can review the outcome of merging any and all includes into a component
manifest file by invoking the following command:

```sh
fx cmc include {{ "<var>" }}cml_file{{ "</var>" }} --includepath $FUCHSIA_DIR
```

Includes can be recursive, meaning that shards can have their own includes.

### program {#program}

Components that are executable include a `program` section. The `program`
section must set the `runner` property to select a [runner][doc-runners] to run
the component. The format of the rest of the `program` section is determined by
that particular runner.

#### ELF runners {#elf-runners}

If the component uses the ELF runner, `program` includes the following
properties:

-   `binary`: Package-relative path to the executable binary
-   `args` _(optional)_: List of arguments

```json5
program: {
    runner: "elf",
    binary: "bin/hippo",
    args: [ "Hello", "hippos!" ],
},
```

See also: [ELF Runner](elf_runner.md)

#### Other runners {#other-runners}

If a component uses a custom runner, values inside the `program` stanza other
than `runner` are specific to the runner. The runner receives the arguments as a
dictionary of key and value pairs. Refer to the specific runner being used to
determine what keys it expects to receive, and how it interprets them.

### children {#children}

The `children` section declares child component instances as described in
[Child component instances][doc-children]

`children` is an array of objects with the following properties:

-   `name`: The name of the child component instance, which is a string of one
    or more of the following characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`, `-`.
-   `url`: The component URL for the child component instance.
-   `startup` _(optional)_: The component instance's startup mode.
    -   `lazy` _(default)_: Start the component instance only if another
        component instance binds to it.
    -   `eager`: ([legacy feature][doc-eager]) Start the component instance as
        soon as its parent starts.
-   `environment` _(optional)_: If present, the name of the environment to be
    assigned to the child component instance, one of
    [`environments`](#environments). If omitted, the child will inherit the same
    environment assigned to this component.

Example:

```json5
children: [
    {
        name: "logger",
        url: "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/logger#logger.cm",
    },
    {
        name: "pkg_cache",
        url: "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/pkg_cache#meta/pkg_cache.cm",

    more of the following characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`, `-`.
-   `durability`: The duration of child component instances in the collection.
    -   `transient`: The instance exists until its parent is stopped or it is
        explicitly destroyed.
    -   `persistent`: The instance exists until it is explicitly destroyed. This
        mode is not yet supported.
-   `environment` _(optional)_: If present, the environment that will be
    assigned to instances in this collection, one of
    [`environments`](#environments). If omitted, instances in this collection
    will inherit the same environment assigned to this component.

        -   `self`: This component.
        -   `#<child-name>`: A [reference](#references) to a child component
            instance.
    -   `as` _(option)_: An explicit name for the runner as it will be known in
        this environment. If omitted, defaults to `runner`.
-   `resolvers`: The resolvers registered in the environment. An array of
    objects with the following properties:
    -   `resolver`: The [name](#capability-names) of a resolver capability,
        whose source is specified in `from`.

    },
],
```

### offer {#offer}

The `offer` section declares the capabilities offered by this component, as
explained in [Routing terminology](#routing-terminology).

`offer` is an array of objects with the following properties:

    -   `runner`: The [name](#capability-names) of a runner capability.
    -   `resolver`: The [name](#capability-names) of a resolver capability.
-   `from`: The source of the capability, one of:
    -   `parent`: The component's parent. This source can be used for all
        capability types.
    -   `self`: This component. Requires a corresponding
        [`capability`](#capabilities) declaration.
    -   `#<child-name>`: A [reference](#references) to a child component
        instance. This source can only be used when offering protocol,
        directory, or runner capabilities.
-   `to`: An array of capability targets, each of which is a

-   `dependency` _(optional)_: The type of dependency between the source and
    targets, one of:
    -   `strong`: a strong dependency, which is used to determine shutdown
        ordering. Component manager is guaranteed to stop the target before the
        source. This is the default.
    -   `weak_for_migration`: a weak dependency, which is ignored during
        shutdown. When component manager stops the parent realm, the source may
        stop before the clients. Clients of weak dependencies must be able to
        handle these dependencies becoming unavailable. This type exists to keep
        track of weak dependencies that resulted from migrations into v2
        components.

Example:

```json5
offer: [
    {
        protocol: "fuchsia.logger.LogSink",
        from: "#logger",
        to: [ "#fshost", "#pkg_cache" ],
        dependency: "weak_for_migration",
    },
    {
        protocol: [
            "fuchsia.ui.app.ViewProvider",
            "fuchsia.fonts.Provider",
        ],
        from: "#session",
        to: [ "#ui_shell" ],
        dependency: "strong",
    },
    {
        directory: "blobfs",
        from: "self",
        to: [ "#pkg_cache" ],
    },
    {
        directory: "fshost-config",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#fshost" ],
        as: "config",
    },
    {
        storage: "cache",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#logger" ],
    },
    {
        runner: "web",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#user-shell" ],
    },
    {
        resolver: "universe-resolver",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#user-shell" ],
    },
],
```

### facets {#facets}

The `facets` section is a JSON object containing [facets](#facet-metadata),
chunks of metadata that components may interpret for their own purposes. The
component framework enforces no schema for this section, but third parties may
expect their facets to adhere to a particular schema.

This section may be omitted.
